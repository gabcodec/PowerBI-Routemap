# Instructions

This repository is a fork of the **PowerBI-Routemap** project.  
It includes fixes to resolve build compilation issues and removes the persistent  
*"bingmapsportal.com"* missing developer keys banner.

Special thanks to **[@dexth3r](https://www.github.com/dexth3r)** and **[@ivanarganda](https://www.github.com/ivanarganda)** for their valuable insights.
